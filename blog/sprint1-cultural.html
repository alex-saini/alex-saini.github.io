                <h2><strong>Identity</strong></h2>

                    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
                        the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest 'ethical' decisions I've ever had to make is deciding whether to stay at University or not. 
                            It was a rough year with health reasons and I had to make the decision of whether to push on and do another year
                            to make up or to cut it entirely and do something else. The problem was I didn't really know about EDA/bootcamps in 
                            general when I was thinking of leaving. In the end I thought it would be a smarter idea to leave as the work was slowly 
                            losing it's touch because of how slow it all got. The consequences of me leaving were all sunny though. 
                            Found out about EDA about 5/6 months later and dove into the realm of coding. I'm happy with the route I've taken and 
                            am excited to see what the future holds.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
                        <p> 
                            My culture has influenced everything that I am, and not only my culture but other cultures that I have met throughout my journey here. 
                            I went to a high-school that was very cultural, where I met and made strong friendships with people from different religions and cultures
                            who have taught and influenced my identity today.
                        </p>   
                    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
                        <p>
                            Over my career/learning development I have found a few key strengths and limitations that define me. 
                            Two of these strengths would be loyalty and trustworthiness. Both strengths have been very present during both work and study and
                            I continue to practice these daily. A limitation I have would probably be my health for the last couple years, where I haven't been
                            able to work/study to the potential that I know that I am capable of. 
                        </p>

                    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>
                        <p>
                            Trustworthiness will help me in my journey at EDA/beyond EDA as it is such a key component in team work. 
                            You have to rely and trust on your colleagues/team mates to pull through on what they said they would do in the
                            time frame they said they would do it in. 
                        </p>

                    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Massey I was studying Design, which was almost always team-based work. A few of the these times there was strong language barriers/cultural differences
                        between team mates, which sometimes led to tasks becoming fairly hard to finish by the due date because of those barriers and miscommunication.
                        Some strategies that we tried were prioritising different work first and making sure that whoever is stuck reaches out for help.
                        Although we did timebox, at the time I think the pomodoro technique would've been very helpful.
