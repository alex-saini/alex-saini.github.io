        <h3><u>How does understanding neuroplasticity help people?</u></h3>
        <p>Noticing the positive effects that neuroplasticity can have on a person ultimitely change how a person works, studies or goes about their general day.
           If people can understand the benefits of re-wiring their brain with healthy and positive habits, they can lead a healthier lifestyle while also seeing
           major improvement in whatever they train their brain to do. Improved focus, memory, happier mind! Personally, I will be taking small steps in order to
           gain certain goals / research certain methods that help grow a stronger and more focused mindset.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><u>What are some ways to increase neuroplasticity?</u></h3>
        <p>Immersing yourself into new challenges. Following a plan and keeping to it. But three written ways I have found are these:
           <ul>
               <li>Setting meaningful goals</li>
               <li>Practicing mindfulness regularly</li>
               <li>Adopting a growth mindset lifestyle</li>
           </ul>

        <h2><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h3><u>What is Growth Mindset and how have I been interacting with it?</u></h3>
        <p>Growth Mindset is the belief that you can develop your talents through *hard work, good strategies and input from others. It is the opposite
            of a fixed mindset - which enables the beliefs of "something is too hard so I give up" or taking the easier route. Growth Mindset is constantly
            challenging yourself to enable strong neuro connections, it is the belief of constant learning and forever pushing yourself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Personally I don't think I have been engaging with these beliefs enough, I had a week and a bit off from study and getting back into a routine
            and rhythm is both faustrating and difficult. But learning some of the small neuroplasticity principals and working with them I think will help get
            me into a concrete work routine which can hopefully be build on the foundations of a growth mindset.

    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h3><u>All 3 together!</u></h3>
        <p>I need to start questioning my assumptions when it comes to study and also start believing in my ability to figure things out. 
            These are the two aspects I will add into my learning plan to start developing a growth mindset.
