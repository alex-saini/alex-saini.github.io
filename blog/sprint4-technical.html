    <h3><u>A time I got blocked on a simple problem.</u><h3>
         <p class="text">
            Not that much of a simple problem, but a simple solution to the problem... I was doing the JS Gradebook exercise within the Kata and couldn't seem to debug why my code wasn't working.
            I had been doing the work for a few hours without a break so my mind was relatively fuzzy at this point.
        </p>

    <h3><u>How did I solve it? What techniques did I use and what I did I learn?</u><h3>
        <p class="text">
            I first went through the code and tried to properly decipher what was wrong, went to the internet straight after, and after a hour of tedious research I went to seek help from a tutor.
            I gave Ollie a call, and he stepped me through the process of what I had done wrong, and it seemed to be a notation problem. Even though I had used bracket notation I hadn't placed a '.'
            after so it couldn't access the next property. Guess it shows taking a break every once a while instead of bulking out work is a good idea. Also learn't about the importance of console logging,
            the way that Ollie was console logging to check what was wrong with peices of code showed me how much I was underrating the problem solving technique.
        </p>

    <h3><u>Reflection on problem solving techniques:</u><h3>
        <p class="text">
            <ul class="text">
                <li>Pseudocode: Confident, use it quite regularly on and off the work.</li>
                <li>Trying something: Do it all the time, very confident.</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky method: Don't use it.</li>
                <li>Reading error messages: Do this pretty consistently, confident about using it.</li>
                <li>Console logging: Wasn't too confident before this sprint, but am very confident with console logging now.</li>
                <li>Googling: Very confident.</li>
                <li>Asking your peers for help: Not that confident using this, need to do push myself to ask for help more.</li>
                <li>Asking coaches for help: Confident with doing so if I need too.</li>
                <li>Improving your process with reflection: Confident at reflecting.</li>
            </ul>
