        <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p>My strengths are my loyalty, trustworthiness, motivation, empathy and compassion. My limitations are that I can get easily irritated by things that don't interest me, I can lose interest
        and get distracted by this too. I can keep things to myself when I don't feel as if they will contribute even though they probably could.</p>
        <h3>Workload</h3>
        <p>Being mindful and practicing mindfulness daily. Being mindful of peers and others around me, offering help and asking with discretion but openly. Keeping in a routine, waking up at a certain
            time, eating healthy, exercising, practicing work techniques such as pomodoro so I can timebox and work more effeciently. Using breathing exercises and taking breaks when scheduled to relieve
            stress and keep my mind fresh.</p>
        <h3>Seeking help</h3>
        <p>If I'm blocked with work, I will first look over what I'm doing, then head to the internet for answers. If still blocked I will head to students/peers/tutors for help when suits them and myself.</p>
        <h3>What I expect from the team</h3>
        <p>I expect a level of support with work, for the team to be understanding, helpful and give meaningful critisicm/tell me how to improve my work if I am not doing something properly.</p>
