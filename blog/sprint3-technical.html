    <h3><u>Describe an analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</u><h3>
         <p class="text">
            A cellphone. The HTML is the internals of the phone, the motherboard, the circuitry etc. The CSS is the aesthetics of the phone.
            The screen saver, the colour of the phone, the case or the accessories.
        </p>

    <h3><u>Control Flow and loops in daily life?</u><h3>
        <p class="text"> 
            Control flow and loops could be considered as starting a car. You open the door, key in ignition, start the car, put it in D and then foot
            on the gas. If you were to mess up or put a step like putting foot on the gas when the car isn't in D, the car wouldn't go anywhere. Just like
            the function wouldn't execute because the step wasn't executed properly.
        </p>   
     <h3><u>THE DOM!</u><h3>
         <p class="text">
            The DOM is an abbreviation for Document Object Model. It is a interface that allows HTML documents to be minipulated using languages and browsers.
            You can use tools such as DevTools to interact with the DOM.
        </p>

    <h3><u>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</u><h3>
        <p class="text">
            Arrays and Objects are both 'containers' for holding code. Arrays are listed data that you can access with it's assigned number, starting
            at 0. Objects on the other hand are data that contains properties.
        </p>
    <h3><u>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</u><h3>
        <p class="text">
            Functions are specific blocks that hold certain code. These blocks return values, can be used repetitively throughout your work and keep
            your code tidy!
